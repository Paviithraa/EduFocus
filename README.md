# SIGN LANGUAGE DETECTOR

This repository contains the implementation of a sign language detector is a system designed to recognize and interpret hand gestures used in sign language. This technology leverages computer vision and machine learning to identify specific hand movements and translate them into text or speech, enabling communication for individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing

## ðŸŽ¯ **Key components**

Camera: Captures real-time video of the user's hand gestures.
XIAO ESP32S3
Image Processing: Converts video frames into a format suitable for analysis.
Machine Learning Model: Trained to recognize different hand signs based on a dataset of labeled images.
Output Interface: Displays the recognized text or converts it to speech for communication.

##  **How It Works:**

Capture: The camera captures a continuous video feed of the user's hand gestures.
Preprocess: The video frames are processed to isolate the hand and remove the background.
Recognition: The processed images are fed into a trained machine learning model that classifies the hand gesture.
Translation: The recognized gesture is translated into corresponding text or speech
